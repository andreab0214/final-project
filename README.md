# Final Project - onSite

This is my final project for Concordia Bootcamps.
Its a website that companies can purchase an account and add managers and users in order to manage all their site inspections. They will be able to add jobs to their users (including drawings, notes and forms that need to be filled in). Once a site inspection is finished they can approve jobs or add more comments to the user.
